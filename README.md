I'm someone who enjoys working with data , not just for the numbers, but to understand people and improve real-life outcomes.
 My most recent project explored why people stop paying for their life insurance policies.

I love digging into data to solve real-world problems. In my latest project, I explored why people let their life insurance policies lapse and how companies can reduce it. I used **R** and a curious mind to turn patterns into actionable recommendations.

Now, I’m ready to bring that same energy into a data analyst role and I’m open to opportunities worldwide 🌍
